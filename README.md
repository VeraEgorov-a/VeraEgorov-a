### Vera Egorova

I'm a Associate Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the **Universidad de Cantabria** since 2018. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the **Universitat Politècnica de València** in 2016.

**Research Interests:**
- Numerical Methods for Free Boundary PDE Problems (e.g., option pricing, population models, wildfire propagation)
- Efficient Algorithms for Special Functions (e.g., non-central beta distribution function, incomplete beta function)

**Teaching:**

I teach Calculus and Numerical Methods to engineering students.
